## Privacy Policy for Ro-GroupCatcher
**Privacy Policy for Roblox OAuth Chrome Extension**

Last Updated: **March 29, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use the Roblox OAuth Chrome Extension ("Extension"). We take your privacy seriously, and we are committed to protecting your personal information.

## 1. Information We Collect
When you use our Extension, we may collect and store the following types of data:

- OAuth Authentication Data:
When you authenticate via Roblox OAuth, we collect basic user information provided by Roblox, including but not limited to your user ID, username, display name, and email address (if provided). This information is used to identify you and personalize your experience with the Extension.

- Group Data:
If you grant the required permissions, we may also collect data related to your group memberships on Roblox, such as the groups you belong to and your roles within those groups. This information is necessary to perform actions related to group management, such as checking if you're a group owner or member.

- OAuth Access Token:
The Extension will store an OAuth access token temporarily in the browser’s local storage for the purpose of making authenticated requests to Roblox's API.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
The data we collect is used for the following purposes:

- Authentication: To log you into the Extension and authenticate your session using Roblox OAuth.

- Group Management: To check your group memberships and roles (e.g., to determine if you are the owner of a group).

- Extension Functionality: To provide the core features of the Extension, including scanning group members, verifying group ownership, and performing any requested actions on Roblox.

- Storing Preferences: To store your authentication status and preferences, such as whether auto-kick for banned users is enabled.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
We use Chrome’s localStorage and chrome.storage APIs to securely store your authentication token and preferences within the Extension. This data is stored locally in your browser and is not shared with third parties.

- Encryption: The data stored in the Extension (e.g., OAuth token) is not encrypted by default, so we recommend that you do not share your account or authentication details with anyone.

We follow standard security practices to ensure your data is protected while interacting with our Extension. However, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share your data with third parties unless required by law or with your explicit consent. Your OAuth token and any personal data will only be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and are not sold or shared with advertisers.

## 5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
The Extension may use cookies or other tracking technologies for purposes such as:

- Remembering your authentication status across sessions.

- Storing user preferences, such as the group you want to scan when logged into Roblox.

You may disable cookies in your browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality of the Extension.

## 6. User Control and Rights
You have the following rights in relation to your personal data:

- Access: You can request access to the personal data we have stored about you (such as your user ID and username) through the Extension or by contacting us directly.

- Deletion: You can delete your data by logging out of the Extension or clearing your browser’s storage.

- Opt-Out: If you no longer wish to use the Extension, you can uninstall it from your browser at any time. Deleting the Extension will also delete the stored data related to the Extension from your local storage.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
Our Extension is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from users under 13 years old. If you believe that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us so we can remove the data.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting your data.
